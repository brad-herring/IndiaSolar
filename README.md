# IndiaSolar
Deep analysis of solar power plant data from India

Topics covered in this project:
- Goal-oriented graphical analysis (inverter vs. total power output)
- Matplotlib features
- Presentation of data
- Pandas dataframe manipulation
- Usage of Numpy to obtain proper data formats

Possible future updates:
- Graphical representation of power output vs. time batches
- Combination of related datasets (inverter and plant data)
- Forecasting methods
- Clustering to determine what factors contribute to low power output
